**Diploma Thesis** 
Topic: **Design of Automatic Control for Storage Cameras in a Controlled Atmosphere.**
**TLDR:**
  - The diploma thesis develops a system for monitoring and controlling the parameters of the controlled        atmosphere in storage chambers.
  - The system uses sensors to measure levels of CO₂, O₂, ethanol, temperature, and humidity, which are         connected to an Arduino microcontroller. The microcontroller processes the data and takes actions to        maintain optimal conditions in the storage chambers.
  - The program code provides continuous measurement of sensor values and compares them with predefined         threshold values for each chamber.
  - A Nextion touch display is used for data visualization, where CO₂, O₂, temperature, humidity, and           ethanol values are displayed in separate text fields for each chamber.
  - The system ensures reliable monitoring and control of the controlled atmosphere parameters in the           storage chambers.
  - The system can be expanded and adapted to the specific needs and requirements of the storage industry.
  - A laboratory model of the system has been created.
